iam's open source tpt server

 

If used in another project please give me credit

 

An example server is being run at iam.starcatcher.us:3100. Register at http://iam.starcatcher.us:3100/register


Connect with these clients:

Windows:
   http://starcatcher.us/TPT/iam/iam%20server.zip
Linux:

   http://starcatcher.us/TPT/iam/iam%20server%20linux64.zip
Mac:

   http://starcatcher.us/TPT/iam/iam%20server%20mac.zip


Source can be found here
    http://iam.starcatcher.us/iam/TPTServer/src/master

 
Setup

    1. Install mongodb
    2. Install node.js
    3. Install needed node.js libraries (using npm is the easiest way)
    4. Run install.js (node install.js)
    5. Run main.js (node main.js)

 
How to use

    When running properly, a register page can be found at http://<yourWebsite>:<port>/register
    Creating a client and connecting are explained later

 
Changing Server port

    At the bottom of main.js you can change the line
        http.listen(3000, function(){
    to change the port the server runs on

 
Searching

    Features
        sorting (sort:<field>)
        history search (history:<id>)
        user search (user:<username>)
        search search ()
    
    search fields: ['ID', 'DateCreated', 'Date', 'Version', 'Score', 'ScoreUp', 'ScoreDown', 'Views', 'Name', 'ShortName', 'Username', 'Published']
    
    example usage:
        sort:id
        
    A '!' can be put after sort: to reverse the order of the saves
    ex.
        sort:!id

 
Creating Client

    To make a client for you server you must compile the tpt source which can be downloaded here https://github.com/simtr/The-Powder-Toy
    
    modify lines
        #define SERVER
    and
        #define STATICSERVER
    in
        /src/Config.h
    to have your server address, then compile the source using the instructions here http://powdertoy.co.uk/Wiki/W/Main_Page.html#How_to_Build


I can be found in #powder (iam or iamaway). Feel free to ask about the server code, how to set it up, or anything else you want to know.
If you find a bug please tell me!
